        <h2 class="font">Our Founders</h2>
        <img src="JoeSmithbusiness.webp" alt="Our founder in the ocean" class="man" width="250">
        <p>The founder of SeaChains is Isla Navarro, an ocean conservationist with a deep-rooted passion for marine life. Growing up near the coast, Isla witnessed firsthand the devastating effects of pollution on marine ecosystems. A marine biologist by training, she became determined to find sustainable ways to preserve ocean habitats and combat plastic waste. After years of research and collaboration with environmental groups, she founded SeaChains to create innovative solutions for ocean cleanup, promote environmental education, and advocate for policy changes. Isla is driven by the belief that the health of the seas is directly tied to the well-being of the planet, and she envisions a future where humans coexist harmoniously with the oceans. With her warm yet determined leadership, she inspires volunteers, scientists, and activists to come together for a cleaner, healthier ocean.</p>

        <h2 class="font">Our Rescues</h2>
        <img src="whale-shark-swimming.jpg" alt="Demi the whale shark swimming" class="wave" width="400">
        <p>We have rescued over 150 marine animals since 2005. Our best (and favorite) example HAS to be Demi, a Whale Shark rescued by one of our amazing teams back in 2010. She was rescued from the Gulf of Mexico when she was being pursued by poachers. Now, she lives happily in our beatiful marine sanctuary!</p>
